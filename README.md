# NFTdataanalysis

In this project, we analyze "Tales of Terra" NFTs. They are in the form of cards, which contain following features: token id, name, description, Author, GMI Level, Card Rarity and Series. Our goal is to retrieve information about tfts itself, propose a way to rate their rarity and get information about the transactions which involved NFTs, as well as visualize the results. This NFT is available through following link:
